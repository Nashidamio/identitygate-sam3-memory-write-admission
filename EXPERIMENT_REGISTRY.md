---

## EXP000 — Environment sanity (bookkeeping only)
- Purpose: Placeholder to verify registry format.
- Status: PLANNED (no run).
- Notes: First real experiment will be a single-video SAM 3.1 smoke test after Task 1 (env + checkpoints) completes.

## EXP013 - Full event-bearing attribute scan
- Purpose: Compute GT-only per-track attributes over every MOSEv2 train video containing at least one qualifying event.
- Hypothesis: Enlarging beyond the 291-video convenience pool will provide enough candidate data for a defensible hard stratum.
- Code version: 2dcd019.
- Dataset: MOSEv2 train, 3,666 videos; event-bearing subset.
- Checkpoint: None; GT-only CPU experiment.
- Configuration file: None.
- Seed: None.
- Command: python scripts/exp013_attrs.py 0
- Output location: experiments/EXP013_attrs.csv
- Result: 1,691 videos; 3,237 tracks; 4,469 events.
- Status: COMPLETED.
- Interpretation: Full event-bearing attribute pool is available and exactly reconciles EXP006 event count.

## EXP014 - Synchronized-reappearance visual audit
- Purpose: Test the EXP011 interpretation that synchronized reappearances represent whole-scene occlusion.
- Hypothesis: Timing synchronization alone is insufficient to establish whole-scene occlusion.
- Code version: milestone working tree based on 2dcd019.
- Dataset: MOSEv2 train; five synchronized-reappearance clusters identified from EXP011.
- Checkpoint: None; GT/raw-frame audit.
- Configuration file: None.
- Seed: None.
- Command: python scripts/exp014_sync_visual_audit.py
- Output location: experiments/EXP014_sync_visual_audit/
- Result: 82 video-flagged events; 78 event-level synchronized events; 4 false inclusions. Five clusters visually audited.
- Status: COMPLETED.
- Interpretation: Whole-scene-occlusion interpretation rejected. Most audited clusters are consistent with camera-induced out-of-view/re-entry; sync timing is retained only as diagnostic evidence.

## EXP015 - Full-pool GT-only lever feasibility
- Purpose: Apply the existing EXP012 GT-only hardening levers to the full EXP013 event-bearing pool.
- Hypothesis: Pool enlargement resolves the sample-size failure seen in EXP012.
- Code version: milestone working tree based on 2dcd019.
- Dataset: MOSEv2 train via experiments/EXP013_attrs.csv.
- Checkpoint: None; GT-only CPU experiment.
- Configuration file: None.
- Seed: None.
- Command: python scripts/exp015_fullpool_levers.py
- Output location: experiments/EXP015_fullpool_levers.csv and experiments/EXP015_fullpool_levers.md
- Result: 4,469 events; 3,237 tracks; 1,691 videos; 31 non-redundant rules; 17 rules retain >=210 videos.
- Status: COMPLETED.
- Interpretation: Raw candidate-pool size is no longer the headroom bottleneck.

## EXP016 - Fresh hard-stratum B0 headroom
- Purpose: Measure vanilla SAM 3.1 recovery headroom on a fresh, score-independent GT-hard sample.
- Hypothesis: A fresh sample satisfying obj_size < 0.005 AND n_frames >= 100 will lower B0 POR_hard_w30 enough to provide intervention headroom.
- Code version: full scientific run PENDING clean milestone commit; parent 2dcd019.
- Dataset: MOSEv2 train; EXP016 frozen headroom-development manifest.
- Checkpoint: SAM 3.1 installed project checkpoint/model builder.
- Configuration file: experiments/EXP016_headroom_manifest.json
- Seed: 42.
- Commands: python scripts/exp016_make_headroom_manifest.py; python scripts/exp016_headroom.py sanity; full command pending.
- Output location: experiments/EXP016_headroom_manifest.json; local sanity artifact experiments/EXP016_sanity/results.json.
- Result so far: 40 fresh selected videos; 60 eligible tracks; 112 hard events. Sanity 3/3 videos completed, 7/7 eligible events matched, max VRAM 5.67 GB.
- Status: RUNNING - manifest and sanity VERIFIED; 40-video B0 run pending.
- Interpretation: Runner/API/event filtering are verified. Sanity POR is not scientific evidence.

### EXP016 completion note - 2026-08-24
- Code version: 37e3ed0b3beec010c43429bb336042d7d85dcd34.
- Command: python scripts/exp016_headroom.py full
- Output location: experiments/EXP016_full/results.json
- Result: 40 videos; 120 total events; 112/112 frozen hard events scored.
- Hard POR: W15=0.5804, W30=0.6071, W60=0.6071.
- All-event POR: W15=0.6083, W30=0.6333, W60=0.6333.
- Theft events: 2 across 1 track.
- Runtime: 19.9 min.
- Peak VRAM: 12.38 GB.
- Status: COMPLETED.
- Interpretation: Predeclared B0 headroom criterion passes because POR_hard_w30=0.6071 <= 0.70. This validates the candidate hard-stratum rule for split construction but does not itself lock final TRAIN/DEV/TEST.

## EXP017 - Final split construction
- Purpose: Freeze leakage-controlled hard-stratum and full-event-bearing evaluation cohorts.
- Hypothesis: GT-only split construction can satisfy sample-size, event-count, headroom, and development-exclusion requirements without model-score cherry-picking.
- Code version: source parent 9e4cac1; generator hashes recorded in manifests where available.
- Dataset: MOSEv2 train partition.
- Checkpoint: None; GT-only split construction.
- Configuration: obj_size < 0.005 AND n_frames >= 100; seed 42.
- Commands: scripts/exp017_make_candidate_splits.py and scripts/exp017_make_full_distribution.py.
- Outputs: experiments/EXP017_split_manifest.json and experiments/EXP017_full_distribution_manifest.json.
- Result: TRAIN=100, DEV=40, hard TEST=118/343 hard events; full-event-bearing TEST=118/295 events; 9-video TEST/Test overlap; 227 unique held-out TEST videos; zero TEST overlap with TRAIN, DEV, or 81 development exclusions.
- Status: COMPLETED / LOCKED.
- Interpretation: Dataset selection and held-out cohort construction are complete. Future model results may not change these splits.



## SUBSTRATE CORRECTION — AMENDMENT A1 — 2026-08-28

Status: **LOCKED / USER-APPROVED**

Effective for all model-based experiments after A1:

- Core model: SAM 3 VOS/PVS.
- Builder: `build_sam3_video_model()`.
- Upstream checkpoint identity: `facebook/sam3/sam3.pt`.
- True SAM 3.1 Object Multiplex is a transfer/extension substrate only.
- SAM 3.1 checkpoint identity:
  `facebook/sam3.1/sam3.1_multiplex.pt`.

Historical registry entries that describe
`build_sam3_video_model()` runs as “SAM 3.1” are retained for provenance but
their model-version label is **SUPERSEDED by Amendment A1**.

In particular:
- EXP016 is a SAM 3 VOS B0 headroom experiment.
- EXP018 is SAM 3 VOS signal-path engineering evidence.
- EXP020 is SAM 3 VOS relational-pointer feasibility evidence.
- GT-only experiments are unaffected.

No historical metric is changed by this correction.

### EXP017 supersession note - 2026-08-31

- Historical EXP017 manifests and measurements are retained unchanged for provenance.
- EXP017 as the final thesis TRAIN/DEV/TEST split is **SUPERSEDED**.
- Its previously exposed TRAIN+DEV videos remain only a development-exposure boundary.
- Final DEV/TEST construction must obey the later locked leakage rules and development exclusions.
- No historical EXP017 metric or manifest is rewritten.

## EXP018 - SAM 3 VOS signal-path engineering probe

- Purpose: Verify current-core VOS signal availability, per-object pointer access, object-score semantics, and the mask-prompt API required for later signal extraction.
- Hypothesis: The SAM 3 VOS path exposes the per-object identity and quality primitives required for IdentityGate development.
- Code version: exact producing commit UNKNOWN; surviving probe files remain untracked as of 2026-08-31.
- Dataset: MOSEv2 train, development-exposed video 7744dc51.
- Checkpoint: SAM 3 VOS/PVS; `facebook/sam3/sam3.pt` under Amendment A1.
- Configuration file: None recorded.
- Seed: None.
- Command: UNKNOWN / not recovered from surviving evidence.
- Output location: `experiments/EXP018_signal_probe_attempt1_failed.txt`; `experiments/EXP018_signal_probe_attempt2.txt`.
- Result: Attempt 1 failed because `add_new_mask` received a NumPy mask instead of a Torch tensor. Attempt 2 verified `hidden_dim=256`, `mem_dim=64`, `max_obj_ptrs_in_encoder=16`, per-object `obj_ptr [1,256]` float32, `object_score_logits [1,1]`, `iou_score [1]`, and four-object `maskmem_features [4,64,72,72]` bf16.
- Status: COMPLETED engineering probe; attempt 1 FAILED, attempt 2 COMPLETED.
- Interpretation: SAM 3 VOS exposes usable per-object identity pointers. No predictive-utility claim is supported by this probe.

## EXP019 - Whole-scene annotation candidate census

- Purpose: Apply the frozen WS-v1 annotation rule over the full event-bearing corpus and create annotation-side whole-scene candidates without using model outcomes.
- Hypothesis: The annotation rule can provide candidates for later independent pixel-side confirmation.
- Code version: 527b8d8.
- Dataset: MOSEv2 train; all 1,691 event-bearing videos and 4,469 qualifying object events.
- Checkpoint: None; GT-only CPU experiment.
- Configuration file: `configs/WS-v1.json`.
- Seed: None recorded.
- Command: `python scripts/exp019_ws_gt_tagging.py`.
- Output location: exact final artifact path UNKNOWN / not recovered in this registry backfill.
- Result: 4,469 raw object events exactly reconstructed; 2,945 annotation-side candidate object events; 2,179 candidate scene events after collapse; 1,524 non-candidate object events; 3,703 analysis events after candidate collapse; 1,281 videos with at least one candidate. Among flagged events, 1,888 had only one reference object.
- Status: COMPLETED / GT_ANNOTATION_CANDIDATES_ONLY_NOT_FINAL_WS_LABELS.
- Interpretation: Annotation timing alone is not a final whole-scene label. Independent pixel cross-check and the predeclared manual audit remain OPEN and mandatory.

## EXP020 - Relational pointer feasibility

- Purpose: Verify that SAM 3 VOS per-object pointers can be aligned exactly with tracked object IDs and compared against tracked competitors.
- Hypothesis: Packed VOS pointer rows preserve the object-ID ordering required for relational identity features.
- Code version: 6646f32.
- Dataset: MOSEv2 train development-exposed video 7744dc51; four frame-0 tracked objects.
- Checkpoint: SAM 3 VOS/PVS; `facebook/sam3/sam3.pt`.
- Configuration file: None recorded.
- Seed: None.
- Command: UNKNOWN / not recovered from surviving evidence.
- Output location: exact artifact path UNKNOWN / not recovered in this registry backfill.
- Result: Four frame-0 anchor pointers were extracted. Packed frame-0 representation had shape `(4,256)` and propagation representation had shape `(4,256)`. Packed row order aligned exactly with the object-ID mapping and matched per-object extraction.
- Status: COMPLETED / TECHNICAL_FEASIBILITY_PASS_SCIENTIFIC_UTILITY_PENDING.
- Interpretation: Tracked-competitor pointer comparison is technically executable on the SAM 3 VOS core. This experiment does not establish predictive utility.

## EXP021 - Relational development-scope freeze

- Purpose: Freeze a leakage-controlled multi-object development scope for relational identity analysis using only already development-exposed videos.
- Hypothesis: Restricting relational work to previously exposed multi-object videos permits utility analysis without touching final TEST.
- Code version: 809ed5d.
- Dataset: Historical EXP017 development-exposed TRAIN+DEV boundary; videos with at least two frame-0 objects.
- Checkpoint: None; scope construction only.
- Configuration file: None recorded.
- Seed: None.
- Command: UNKNOWN / not recovered from surviving evidence.
- Output location: `experiments/EXP021_relational_scope.json`.
- Result: 26 videos total = 18 TRAIN + 8 DEV; 4,066 video frames; expected 22,140 candidate object-frame rows; 1,482 ordered anchor-pair rows; TEST touched = 0. Scope SHA256: `e528ab0b422f57fee371425199f56193c2b54ca103836ae6cf3f364cd8f5e2b2`.
- Status: COMPLETED / FROZEN DEVELOPMENT SCOPE.
- Interpretation: EXP021 defines the no-new-leakage boundary for EXP022 and EXP023 relational development work. It is not a final thesis split.

## EXP022 - Full relational signal census

- Purpose: Characterize self-anchor and tracked-competitor pointer signals, pointer validity, and relational degeneracy across the frozen 26-video development scope.
- Hypothesis: Relational pointer signals are extractable at scale and may contain candidate identity information beyond self similarity.
- Code version: pilot 671e9f7; serialization correction d74f126; full-run freeze 035185d; result commit d370558.
- Dataset: EXP021 relational scope; 26 videos = 18 TRAIN + 8 DEV.
- Checkpoint: SAM 3 VOS/PVS; `facebook/sam3/sam3.pt`; checkpoint SHA256 `9999e2341ceef5e136daa386eecb55cb414446a00ac2b55eb2dfd2f7c3cf8c9e`.
- Configuration file: `configs/EXP022-relational-census-v1.json`.
- Seed: deterministic frozen scope; no stochastic sampling recorded for the full census.
- Command: UNKNOWN / not recovered from surviving evidence.
- Output location: `experiments/EXP022_full/features.csv`; `experiments/EXP022_full/anchor_cosine.csv`; `experiments/EXP022_full/summary.json`.
- Result: 26/26 videos; 22,140 candidate object-frame rows; 1,482 anchor rows; TEST touched = 0. Overall valid-pointer fraction = 0.5567299006. Approximately 71.6% of valid rows had negative self-minus-competitor margin. Pointer validity varied strongly by video.
- Status: COMPLETED / VERIFIED.
- Interpretation: Relational signals exist, but predictive utility is NOT established. `pointer_valid` remains a validity mask, not silently a predictive feature. Negative identity margin is not evidence of theft. B3-R remains KEEP-BUT-NOT-FROZEN.

## EXP023 - TRAIN18 production primitive cache

- Purpose: Cache definition-independent SAM 3 primitives and raw FP32 pointers needed for later B2 vs B3-S vs B3-R utility analysis without manufacturing clean-state-dependent features.
- Hypothesis: The frozen extractor can reproduce verified EXP022 primitives and generate a canonical TRAIN-only development cache without touching DEV or TEST.
- Code version: signal-schema freeze b9ed7b3; production freeze 41a31ea; provenance correction 29f6332; production result commit 801d8ea.
- Dataset: 18 multi-object TRAIN videos from the frozen EXP021 development scope.
- Checkpoint: SAM 3 VOS/PVS; `facebook/sam3/sam3.pt`; checkpoint SHA256 `9999e2341ceef5e136daa386eecb55cb414446a00ac2b55eb2dfd2f7c3cf8c9e`.
- Configuration file: `configs/EXP023-primitive-cache-v1.json`.
- Seed: deterministic frozen scope; no stochastic sampling recorded for production extraction.
- Command: exact invocation UNKNOWN; execution provenance is preserved in `experiments/EXP023_train18_run.log`.
- Output location: `experiments/EXP023_train18_cache/`; run log `experiments/EXP023_train18_run.log`.
- Result: 18/18 videos; 13,524 primitive data rows; 57 cache files = 18 per-video pointer NPZ + 18 per-video primitive CSV + 18 per-video summary JSON + merged `primitives.csv`, `index.csv`, and `summary.json`. DEV touched = 0; TEST touched = 0.
- Result hashes: merged `primitives.csv` = `c13fddfcc7fe422893e5cfed86100d9a8407abb0421c6296f5ed168a34e92feb`; `index.csv` = `9e73e27506d540aab63dd55e2a07a4b5e7e5c8e18e54b393e0891c4d1fa36db0`; `summary.json` = `145889fc5e26c021e8e083956baa7a1b01333357f137ce3c4da42c33448946ce`; run log = `e3cab3898963f559397da9b7bb35213338273fb05afbe2977ad6fa9b23e56e15`.
- Status: COMPLETED / VERIFIED.
- Interpretation: Canonical TRAIN primitive evidence for the first incremental utility analysis is available. Features 4, 8, 9, and 11 remain DEFERRED; Feature 7 remains OPEN. No IdentityGate model has been trained and no B2/B3 utility claim has been established.

### Registry backfill open item - 2026-08-31

- EXP001 through EXP012 remain missing from this registry.
- Their provenance is recoverable from `docs/RESEARCH_HISTORY.md`.
- Backfilling EXP001-EXP012 is OPEN / NON-BLOCKING and is intentionally deferred so it does not delay current B2/B3 utility work.

## EXP024 - TRAIN-only incremental signal utility probe

Status: COMPLETE / DEVELOPMENT-ONLY / TEST UNTOUCHED

- Common pointer-valid complete-case population: 7,948 rows
- Validation: leave-one-video-out by video

- Theft B3-R: AP 0.0189913995, AUROC 0.5466326466

Paired video-cluster bootstrap, 5,000 replicates:
- Theft B3-S minus B2-core AP 95% CI: [-0.0115334347, -0.0001670046]
- Theft B3-S minus B2-core AUROC 95% CI: [-0.1015720295, -0.0032966214]

- Drift B3-R minus B3-S AUROC 95% CI: [-0.0110033203, -0.0008245190]
- Other reported drift comparisons cross zero.

Sparse-cluster limitation:
- Theft positives: 143 rows in only 5 videos.
- 16 of 5,000 theft bootstrap replicates had no evaluable positive class and were reported invalid.

Interpretation:
- Tested self-identity and relational-identity additions did not demonstrate incremental utility over B2-core in this TRAIN-only probe.
- Theft results statistically favor B2-core over B3-S and B3-R under the specified clustered bootstrap.
- This is NOT evidence that B2 improves closed-loop SAM3 tracking.
- This is NOT a final TEST result.

## EXP025 - Closed-loop write-block mechanism sanity

Status: COMPLETE / MECHANISM VERIFIED / NOT FINAL GATE

Producing commits:
- ce4c664 EXP025: freeze closed-loop write-block sanity
- 79b462d EXP025: correct closed-loop propagation count

Scope:
- MOSEv2 TRAIN-exposed video 0442a954
- Frames 0..59
- Objects: 1, 2
- Deterministic whole-frame non-conditioning-memory eviction on frames 1..30
- DEV touched: 0
- TEST touched: 0

Verified mechanism:
- 30/30 blocked frames were present in global and per-object memory before eviction.
- 30/30 were absent after eviction.
- frames_already_tracked remained present.
- First intervention-frame prediction was identical between B0 and BLOCK.
- First downstream mask difference occurred at frame 2.
- Total downstream B0-vs-BLOCK XOR pixels: 46177.
- Therefore memory-write intervention changes subsequent closed-loop SAM3 tracking behaviour.

Descriptive tracking result:
- B0 mean target IoU on visible rows: 0.8243956364947009
- deterministic BLOCK mean target IoU: 0.8232898540701283
- delta BLOCK minus B0: -0.001105782424572599
- This is NOT evidence of tracking improvement.

Frozen acceptance rule:
- PASS only if every object-frame binary prediction mask is exactly equal.

Observed:
- comparison rows: 120
- exact rows: 22
- exact fraction: 0.18333333333333332
- first difference: frame 1, object 1, XOR 2 px

## EXP027 - Per-object attention-filter mechanism

Status: COMPLETE / IMPLEMENTATION ROUTE REJECTED / NO GATE RESULT

Producing commits:
- 6d27569 EXP027: freeze per-object attention filter helper
- 758b8e7 EXP027: freeze per-object filter sanity
- cb077f0 EXP027: fix attention filter patch indentation

Scope:
- TRAIN-exposed video 0442a954
- 60 frames
- batched frozen SAM3 retained
- intended selective object-level memory-attention filtering
- DEV touched: 0
- TEST touched: 0

Observed:
- Vanilla batched B0 executed.
- Patched NO-BLOCK executed after the indentation correction.
- Selective filtering failed when the first non-empty memory_key_padding_mask reached the active TransformerDecoderLayerv2.forward_pre path.
- Active forward_pre asserts that memory_key_padding_mask must be None.

Decision:
- The memory_key_padding_mask Track-B route is rejected for the pinned SAM3 configuration.
- The frozen acceptance criteria were not relaxed.
- No selective-filter tracking result was produced.
- This is an engineering-route result, not evidence for or against B2 tracking performance.

Failed-run hashes:
- attempt 1 indentation failure: 869b3e40e33c29815cf253f483e7d12a32442adacc696535591b14d8c52394e4

Frozen control requirement:
- ROWWISE FULL-MEMORY must exactly reproduce VANILLA B0 before selective blocking.
- Exactness covered binary masks, object_score_logits, iou_score, obj_ptr, maskmem_features, and global eff_iou_score.
- No tolerance relaxation was permitted.

Observed control:
- status: ROWWISE_CONTROL_FAIL.
- comparison rows: 120.

- vanilla runtime: 6.997359037399292 s.
- control runtime: 7.866125583648682 s.

Interpretation:
- Because the full-memory control used zero blocked-frame omissions, the observed differences are caused by the rowwise recomputation path itself rather than by a gate decision.
- The frozen exact-equivalence criterion failed.
- ROWWISE hybrid is therefore rejected as a per-object gating implementation route.
- The selective-block condition was not executed.
- This experiment provides no B2/B3 tracking-performance result.

Resources:
- B0 peak VRAM: 6.266373634338379 GB.

Interpretation:
- A learned neural gate now demonstrably controls physical closed-loop SAM3 memory writes and changes subsequent predictions.
- EXP030 does not establish tracking improvement, generalization, calibration, or final B2 performance.
- The fixed tau=0.5 operating point admitted only 4/59 frames, so write-budget control is mandatory before performance comparison.

## EXP038 - A4 rate-selector sanity

Status: SELECTOR SANITY PASS / NOT PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE

Frozen implementation commit:
- 59395074dc98b38d0c1feeca18a205c48b4f52a8

Defect-fix and successful executed commit:
- 4a5f44fc226be88a9c074cb67b69572b22cffda3

Scope:
- TRAIN-exposed video: 0442a954.
- Frames: 60.
- Object IDs: [1, 2].
- Variants: B1, B2, B3-S, B3-R.
- A4 target-order search began at 0.5 and all required sanity variants matched there.
- Fresh final DEV touched: false.
- TEST touched: false.
- B5 included: false.

Observed:
- B1: tau 0.35, write rate 0.4915254237288136, absolute error 0.008474576271186418, 1 midpoint refinement.
- B2: tau 0.1875, write rate 0.5084745762711864, absolute error 0.008474576271186418, 3 midpoint refinements.
- B3-S: tau 0.2, write rate 0.5084745762711864, absolute error 0.008474576271186418, 0 midpoint refinements.
- B3-R: tau 0.25, write rate 0.4915254237288136, absolute error 0.008474576271186418, 1 midpoint refinement.
- All four variants satisfied the locked A4 +/-0.02 write-rate tolerance.
- Total executed tau points: 49.
- subset_common_target_not_final_r_star: 0.5.
- Maximum observed peak allocated VRAM: 6.266784191131592 GB.
- Final status: EXP038_A4_SELECTOR_SANITY_PASS.

Execution provenance:
- Original frozen execution failed before a scientific result because Runner did not retain exp037.
- The dependency-only fix was committed separately; A4 scientific rules were unchanged.
- One fixed foreground execution was manually interrupted and produced no final result.
- The subsequent background retry completed successfully.

Interpretation:
- Closed-loop A4 write-rate-only threshold selection is verified for the four gate variants in this TRAIN-exposed sanity scope.
- Coarse thresholds plus deterministic midpoint refinement are operational.
- The selected 0.5 target is not final r_star.
- B5 and fresh DEV are still required before final common-rate selection.
- No comparative performance or final statistical conclusion is supported by EXP038.

## EXP039 - B5 DMS-lite write-side comparator sanity

Status: B5 SANITY PASS / NOT PERFORMANCE EVIDENCE

Frozen implementation commit:
- 4b8b54f058d2187e665d4ea5c5c44015933a2d8a

Scope:
- TRAIN-exposed video: 0442a954.
- Frames: 60.
- Object IDs: [1, 2].
- Variant: B5 DMS-lite write-side comparator.
- Fresh final DEV touched: false.
- TEST touched: false.

Observed:
- Final status: EXP039_B5_DMS_LITE_SANITY_PASS.
- First matched sanity target: 0.5.
- Selected tau: 0.775.
- Realized physical write rate: 0.4915254237288136.
- Absolute rate error: 0.008474576271186418.
- Midpoint refinements: 2.
- Executed tau points: 13.
- Formula rows checked: 1534.
- Actual fail-closed rows observed: 0.
- Synthetic and patched-path FAIL_CLOSED checks passed.
- Exact executed-row B5 formula checks passed.
- A3 frame-min and action-rule checks passed.
- Physical block-integrity checks passed.
- Maximum observed peak allocated VRAM: 6.266374588012695 GB.

Interpretation:
- Frozen A8 B5 scoring is operational on the frozen SAM3 substrate.
- B5 uses the frozen A3 physical whole-frame write intervention.
- Frozen A4 write-rate-only threshold selection is operational for B5 in this TRAIN-exposed sanity scope.
- Target 0.5 and tau 0.775 are not final r_star.
- EXP039 provides no final performance or statistical inference.
- B5 is DMS-lite write-side adaptation and is not claimed to reproduce official SAM3-DMS.

### EXP052 KNOWN METADATA DEFECT - ITR GROUP LABEL

STATUS:
- REPORTING/METADATA DEFECT ONLY.
- Numerical POR30/ITR30 point estimates, bootstrap draws, BCa intervals,
  and the primary POR30 inference are unaffected.
- EXP052 reuses each configured comparison group for both POR30 and ITR30.
- Therefore the ITR30 B3-S-minus-B2 row is incorrectly labelled
  group=PRIMARY in the EXP052 comparison artifacts.
- A10 remains authoritative: POR30 is the sole primary endpoint and ITR30
  is secondary.
- Do not rerun or reinterpret EXP052 because of this label-only defect.
- Correct endpoint-specific group labelling before any TEST inference
  implementation is frozen.

  but both the primary pooled and secondary video-balanced 95% confidence
  intervals include zero. EXP055 therefore does not establish a statistically
  reliable full-video mIoU improvement or degradation for B2.
  This post-defense supplementary result does not modify the frozen
  EXP053/EXP054 confirmatory conclusions.
